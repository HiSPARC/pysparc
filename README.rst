PySPARC
=======

PySPARC is a data acquisition system for the HiSPARC experiment,
implemented in Python.  Ramon Kleiss came up with the excellent name.
Please note that this repository is by no means intended as a replacement
for the LabVIEW DAQ we currently have in operation.  It is merely intended
as a test bed.  As such, the code started out as a gross hack.  We'll see
if it shapes up, in a few commits or so.


Prerequisites
-------------

* `libusb <http://www.libusb.org/>`_
* `PyUSB <https://github.com/walac/pyusb>`_
* `PyFTDI <https://github.com/eblot/pyftdi>`_

I like the fact that we do not depend on FTDI drivers or libraries.


Status
------

Early alpha.  Trust me.


Outlook
-------

Completely undetermined.  Sorry.  But watch this space, you'll never know.
