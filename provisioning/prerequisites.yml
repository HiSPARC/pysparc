# DF: Ok, so here I was following the Redis FAQ to be able to overcommit
# memory. I was going to look at the reason for the large DB next, but
# suspected that the safe-mode was preventing PySPARC from uploading events and
# emptying the DB. Next thing I know the database is still growing, and an
# Ansible run with apt-get upgrade triggers the OOM killer and I end up with an
# unstable system. Yikes. Reversing the decision.
